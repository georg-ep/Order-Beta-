/*
 
 If we combine codable with sending and receiving data from the net we can cnvert swift objects to JSON for sending
 then receive back JSON to be converted into swift objects
 
 URLSession
 this automatically runs in the backgroud
 this is run on the background thread, an independent piece of code which runs the same time as the rest of our program
 
iOS likes to have everything run on the main thread, the thread that the program was started
 this is because it stops 2 pieces of code trying to manipulate the UI simultaneously
